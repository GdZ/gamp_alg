This codepakage is related to the topic,Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) 

## Abstract of Article of MPA 
 Messgae passing Algorithm a.k.a. Belief Propagation (BP) detection,
is used to achieve near-optimal detection in large-Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
systems equipped with both larger numer of transmit and receive antennas at low complexities.
These large- systems can be flexibly deployed for the purpose of wireless back-hauling.
The classic linear detection methods have low complexity but unfavorable performance. The
classic optimum nonlinear detection methods such as Maximum Likelihood (ML) exhibits
prohibitive complexity in the considered large-MIMO systems. This thesis mainly investigates
the BP-based large-MIMO detection method which is well known for its near-optimum
performance and scalable complexity over sparse graphs . But directly applying BP to MIMO
system does not yield a favorable performance because of the densely connected graph. It has
scalable complexity over different graph model. This thesis shows that damping is quite effective
in achieving good performance in large-MIMO detection. Two typical approach based
on BP algorithm, Markov Random Field (MRF) based and Gaussian Approximation Message
Passing (GAMP) are studied.
